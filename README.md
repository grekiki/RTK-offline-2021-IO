# RTK-offline-2021-IO
Parse IO for the offline problem of 2021 RTK competition(https://rtk.ijs.si/2021/pokrajina/)

Code for C++ was provided by Domen Hoƒçevar(https://github.com/DomenHocevar), while I've made the Java and Python implementations.
The programs should read the input file, contain a simple solution that should probably be improved on as part of the problem, and writer to print out the output file in the specified format. The files generated by the programs probably cannot be submitted, since you have to add your submission code you got at registration.  

If you are solving the problem in another language, PRs are welcome.
